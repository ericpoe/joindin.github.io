The leadership team was formed by volunteers responding to an open call for individuals to commit time and energy to taking over the large task of not only the Joind.in open source project but the maintenance of the hosted service. The leadership team all signed and collectively presented the proposal to the Joind.in maintainers. Meet the new Joind.in Leadership Team:
